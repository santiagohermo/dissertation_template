\section{Background}\label{sec:chap1_background}

Lionel Messi joined FC Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, at the age of 13.
His prodigious talent was evident from an early age, and he quickly rose through
the ranks of the club's youth system.

Messi made his first-team debut for Barcelona in 2004, at the age of 17, under 
the coaching of Frank Rijkaard.
He quickly established himself as a key player for the club, showcasing his
remarkable dribbling ability, vision, and goal-scoring prowess.

In fact, Messi's first goal for Barcelona came on May 1, 2005, in a match 
against Albacete.
In the 88th minute of the game, Messi received a pass from Ronaldinho and 
skillfully put the ball above the goalkeeper to celebrate his first goal.
At just 17 years and 10 months old, Messi became the youngest goal scorer in 
the history of the club.

\section{Titles}\label{sec:chap1_titles}

During his time at FC Barcelona, Lionel Messi won numerous titles, as depicted
in Table \ref{tab:messi_barca_titles}.
These include multiple La Liga titles, UEFA Champions League titles, and Copa del Rey
titles.

His position in the field and playing style evolved over the years, as 
different coaches utilized his talents in various ways.
For example, under Pep Guardiola, Messi played as a false nine, dropping deep
to create space for his teammates and exploit opposition defenses.
This constant evolution and adaptation to different roles on the field
demonstrate Messi's versatility and footballing intelligence, and were 
key to his success at Barcelona.

\section{Performance}\label{sec:chap1_performance}

The performance of Lionel Messi during his tenure at FC Barcelona is 
nothing short of extraordinary.
His goal-scoring and playmaking abilities have earned him numerous 
accolades and titles.
Table \ref{tab:messi_barca_goals_assists} showcases Messi's remarkable 
goal and assist statistics, highlighting his immense contribution to the 
team's success.

Messi had a record-breaking calendar year in 2012, scoring 91 goals in all competitions.
This peak performance is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:messi_goals_xg_2012}, which
shows the ratio of goals to expected goals (xG) for Messi and other players
in the 2012/13 season.
Messi consistently outperformed his xG, demonstrating his exceptional finishing
ability and efficiency in front of goal.

Messi was coached by some of the best managers in the world during his time at
Barcelona, including Pep Guardiola, Luis Enrique, and Ronald Koeman.
A key aspect of Messi's success was his ability to adapt to different
tactical systems and playing styles.
For instance, Guardiola implemented a ``false nine'' role for Messi, allowing
him to drop deep and create overloads in midfield.
This tatical innovation is explored in Appendix \ref{sec:false_nine}.

Messi's performances resulted in multiple awards and accolades.
Appendix \ref{sec:ballon_dor} provides a summary of Messi's Ballon 
d'Or awards, highlighting his dominance in world football during his time 
at Barcelona.

\section{Messi's Departure from Barcelona}\label{sec:messi_departure}

Despite the deep connection between Messi and FC Barcelona, a complex 
set of circumstances led to his unexpected departure from the club in 2021.
Financial constraints within Barcelona, coupled with LaLiga's salary cap 
restrictions, made it impossible to renew Messi's contract.
Even with substantial salary concessions on Messi's part, the club could 
not comply with the league's financial regulations. 

This unforeseen turn of events marked a shocking end to an era that had 
defined both the player and the club.
Messi's exit underscored the complexities of modern football, 
highlighting the interplay between sporting ambition and financial 
considerations.

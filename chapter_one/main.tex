His position in the field and playing style evolved over the years, as 
different coaches utilized his talents in various ways.
For example, under Pep Guardiola, Messi played as a false nine, dropping deep
to create space for his teammates and exploit opposition defenses.
This constant evolution and adaptation to different roles on the field
demonstrate Messi's versatility and footballing intelligence, and were 
key to his success at Barcelona.

\section{Performance}\label{sec:chap1_performance}

Messi had a record-breaking season in 2012, scoring 91 goals in all competitions.
This peak performance is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:messi_goals_xg_2012}, which
shows the ratio of goals to expected goals (xG) for Messi and other players.

ability and efficiency in front of goal.

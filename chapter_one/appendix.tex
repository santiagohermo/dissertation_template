One of the most notable tactical innovations during Lionel Messi's time at FC 
Barcelona was his deployment as a false nine.
This positional change, implemented by then-coach Pep Guardiola, revolutionized
the way Messi played and influenced the team's overall style of play.
The false nine role allowed Messi to drop deep into midfield, creating numerical
superiority and overloading opposition defenses.
